# Reddit Liberals vs Conservatives

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have become the predominant way people, businesses and organizations
communicate: companies nowadays invest a lot of resources into social media advertising, while institutional organizations and public figures share information and opinions that can influence millions of people all around the world with just a couple of sentences. 
Group of researchers ([The role of (social) media in political polarization: a systematic review](https://doi.org/10.1080/23808985.2021.1976070)) suggest that social media platforms foster political polarization by creating “echo chambers” that insulate people
from opposing views about current events.

The objective of this project is to apply Natural Language Processing techniques to Reddit
posts labelled "Liberal" or "Conservative" to analyze whether major differences in the topics of
discussion and the sentiment related to it exist between the two political leans.
Being able to automatically identify the political lean of a post may be useful for several reasons:
- to check whether a "neutral" organization is instead following a political agenda.
- together with hate speech analysis to identify if some political parties are associated to
persecutions of specific groups.
- together with social media policies to guarantee free spech and avoid censorship just based on the political lean
